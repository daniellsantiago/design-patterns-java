Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that arise in software design. They provide a way to create modular, maintainable, and scalable software by capturing best practices and proven design principles. 

In this project, I'm gonna update my study notes about some of the most used Design Patterns and Its implementation on a Spring boot API context.

## Creational Patterns

* Singleton Pattern: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## Structural Patterns

* Decorator Pattern: Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.

## Behavioral Patterns

* Observer Pattern: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
* Strategy Pattern: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
